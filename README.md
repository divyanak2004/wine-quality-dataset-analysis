*Analysing the Wine Quality Dataset (Red and White Wine) with Python*

**OVERVIEW**

This repository contains an analysis of the Wine Quality dataset, which explores the factors influencing the quality of wines. The dataset consists of various attributes related to wine composition and quality ratings.The dataset consists of two separate datasets, one for red wine and one for white wine.

DATASET

Red Wine Dataset: [http://localhost:8888/edit/winequality-red.csv](http://localhost:8888/edit/winequality-red.csv)

White Wine Dataset: [http://localhost:8888/edit/winequality-white.csv
](http://localhost:8888/edit/winequality-white.csv)

ANALYSIS

The analysis is divided into several steps, including:

*Data Loading and Exploration:* In the initial phase, the dataset is loaded and explored to understand its structure and characteristics.

*Data Preprocessing:* Data preprocessing steps may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* EDA involves visualizing the data, calculating summary statistics, and identifying correlations between features and wine quality.

*Feature Importance:* Feature importance is determined using machine learning techniques (e.g., Random Forest) to identify the factors that most influence wine quality.

*Model Building and Evaluation:* Machine learning models are built and evaluated to predict wine quality based on selected features.

*Results and Conclusion:* The analysis results are summarized, and conclusions are drawn regarding the most important factors influencing wine quality.

RESULT

Sweeter wines recived higher average rating by 0.01 more.

Wines with higher alcohol content received higher rating.

Positive relation to quality with alcohol.

Alcohol is the most important feature that influence the quality of wine.
